# Shared Task on the Disambiguation of German Verbal Idioms

This is the official repository for the shared task on the disambiguation of German verbal idioms which is organized in connection with [KONVENS 2021](https://konvens2021.phil.hhu.de/). Here you will find all the data necessary to participate in the shared task.

## The task

The identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) is a well known challenge in the natural language processing (NLP) community and has received a lot of attention in recent years - especially thanks to the [PARSEME](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/parseme/index.php/organization) network (PARsing and Multiword Expressions) which organized three shared tasks on this topic in [2017](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1167953/FULLTEXT01.pdf), [2018](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01865575/file/2018-Ramisch-et-al.pdf) and [2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.mwe-1.14.pdf). But while the PARSEME shared tasks were highly multilingual and targeted all VMWE types, we will focus only on German verbal idioms (VIDs). Furthermore, we concentrate on a subtask of the identification process which is the disambiguation of VIDs and their literal counterparts. E.g. if we consider the utterance "Kim is talking to Huey on the big white telephone" we have the two distinct possibilities that Kim is either sick or that she is actually talking to a person called Huey on the phone. The task is to automatically decide for cases like this if the expression has its literal or its idiomatic meaning.

## The data

The shared task data consists of 9906 instances of a German VID type or its literal counterpart in context. The set of VID types was pre-selected, thus it constitutes a lexical sample data set. It is a merger of the [COLF-VID](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.figlang-1.29.pdf) and the [German SemEval-2013 task 5b](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S13-2007.pdf) data sets. Consider this example:

```
T890202.28.4077	in wasser fallen	figuratively	Der Streit ums Hormonfleisch zwischen USA und EG provozierte den Polizeieinsatz . Aber nicht nur der Steakverkauf , auch die Aktionen gegen den Hormonstand , auf die sich Gruppen der Bauernopposition schon vorbereitet hatten , <b>fielen</b> <b>ins</b> <b>Wasser</b> . Die Fleischexporteure der USA wollten ihrerseits die " Grüne Woche " zur " Aufklärung " nutzen .
```

The data comes in tsv files and every line has the following format:

> Instance id \t VID type \t label \t text

So the first column contains the id (```T890202.28.4077``` in the example), the second the VID type (```in wasser fallen```), the third the label (```figuratively```) and the fourth the sentence with either the instance of the VID type or its literal counterpart (and two additional context sentences). The parts of the target expression are marked with the ```<b>``` tag (```<b>fielen</b> <b>ins</b> <b>Wasser</b>```). This means, we assume that another process has already pre-identified the target expressions and the systems only need to decide on the correct reading. There will be four possible labels: ```figuratively```, ```literally```, ```undecidable``` and ```both```. The first two should be self-explanatory. The label ```undecidable``` was used by the annotators if it was not possible to disambiguate an instance given the context. The label ```both``` was applied when both the literal and the idiomatic readings were active. But since in more than 99% of the cases it was either either literal or idiomatic, at the end it basically can be treated as a binary task.

## The timeline

- Trial data ready: April 23, 2021
- Training data ready: May 15, 2021
- Test data ready: June 23, 2021
- Evaluation end: July 30, 2021
- Paper submission due: July 15, 2021
- Camera ready due: August 10, 2021
- Konvens converence: September 6-10, 2021

## The evaluation

The participating teams will be required to submit the test data with the predictions made by their systems. This will be the format of the test data:

```T861224.44.1377	auf tisch liegen	NONE	Band drei vom " Kapital " , die Nummer 25 der blauen Marx-Engels-Werke aus dem Ost-Berliner Dietz-Verlag , wird aufgeschlagen . Ganz weit hinten , so daß das Buch im kräftigem Pappeinband nicht richtig <b>auf</b> dem <b>Tisch</b> <b>liegen</b> will . " Die Klassen " heißt das letzte Kapitel .```

It is the same as the training data with the only difference being that in place of the label one can find the placeholder ```NONE```. These placeholders are to be replaced by the labels the systems predict.

We plan to use [CodaLab](https://codalab.org/) for evaluation, but as of this writing there seem to be some technical difficulties which need to be resolved before we can create the CodaLab website (it is this [issue](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/issues/2931) we're experiencing). But as soon the CodaLab website is ready we will add a link to it here.
